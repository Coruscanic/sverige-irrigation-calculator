# Personal Reflections - Week 1

## Current situation

As a result of this first week, we have been able to form a team of six seemingly skillful members.
We have been able to successfully write our social contract together, despite diverging points of view regarding organization, mainly the roles we should or shouldn't assign to the team members.
We ended up agreeing on what I think is a good compromise, and probably a better solution than what everyone would have been able to come up with alone.
We have also an open discussion about our choice of project, with currently a couple of suggestions.

## Learning objectives

My objectives for the beginning of this course will be to learn how to setup such a project together with the relevant good practices.
From what I understand, I might be the least experimented in software development in the team, which doesn't surprise me due to the strong focus on research, and not as much the industry, in my home university.
I expect this project to be a good opportunity for me to learn.
To achieve that, I intend to participate actively and force me out of my comfort zone, even if it means making mistakes.

## Contributions towards the team

I'm not sure yet what the other team members will be able to learn from me, as we just met and we haven't worked together already, but I will obviously help anyone I'm able to when the opportunity arises.
I also intend to make the most out of the scrum framework and participate actively in the meetings.
Regarding the team deliveries, we haven't yet decided what our project would be, nor have we assigned the roles to the team members, so I am unable say much for now.
