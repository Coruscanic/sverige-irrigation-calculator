Reflection week 1

The lectures and hands-on exercises have helped me to develop a basic understanding of the fundamentals of scrum and how its implementation can be useful in projects. Through this module, I wish to learn and understand scrum processes better by putting what I learned to practice such as defining the definition of done, using key performance indicators, and practicing the sprint cycles of planning, applying, reflecting, and then refining during the entire project. Additionally, I want to better understand the different roles and responsibilities of a scrum master, product owner, etc. I hope to help my team by contributing my ideas and opinions to facilitate more meaningful discussions about our project and help us to produce quality products. I also hope to help my team by contributing my knowledge and expertise on the subject from what I have learned previously. I contributed to the teamâ€™s use of Scrum and deliverables by providing my opinions to help in decision-making so that everyone is able to come to a consensus.
