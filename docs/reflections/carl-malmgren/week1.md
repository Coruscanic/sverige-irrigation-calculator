# Persoanl reflection - Week 1

## Now

I have somehow found myself in a diverse team of exchange students. We have agreed on a social contract that's a good compromise between our views on team structure. I got a taste of agile working building a city in Lego. It was a lot of fun and i look forward to trying it out more.

## Goals

I want to explore working with git in a larger team using more scalable workflows like feature branches and PR reviews. I also want to learn more about working in an agile team since it seems like a valuable skill in the industry. I hope to use my previous programming knowledge to help my team get going faster and make sound architectural design decisions. 

## Path

Since i know very little about how to work in a scrum team i will try to be active in meetings and reflect on how things are decided. I will try to guage the teams experiance with the tools we are using, like git, and make sure everyone is on an as even playing field as possible going forward.
