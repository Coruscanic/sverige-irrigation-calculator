Xavier Goh
Individual Report Week 1

For the first week of lectures and activities, my main takeaways were the basic team structure and working cycles (sprints) of agile. I also had the good fortune of joining a group of many talented individuals with prior experience hence I believe i will have the opportunity to learn to many things from them.

As the group is in the planning stage, I hope to learn about the typical details of the sprint planning process. With my current limited knowledge about Agile and scrum methodology, i hope to contribute project ideas wherever I can and enjoy the development process.
