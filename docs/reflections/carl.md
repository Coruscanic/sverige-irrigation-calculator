# Carl Malmgren Individual reflection 

I want to explore working with git in a larger team using more scalable workflows like feature branches and PR reviews. I also want to learn more about working in an agile team since it seems like a valuable skill in the industry.

I’m quick to pick-up and learn new technical concepts and frameworks and then explain how they work to others. 

I have never worked with scrum before so right now i won’t be able to contribute more than just being part of the team.

I’m quite experienced with programming and can contribute to high level architectural design decisions.
